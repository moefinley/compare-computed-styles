# Basic implementation of Frozen DOM/Computed Style testing
 
## Roadmap 
 
### Short term
 - Move the load file form to a dialog box
 - Remove Protractor and replace with a standard Selenium
 - Move page and element configuration to JSON file
 - Convert Node application to Typescript (then share 'file-operations' module)
 - Create shorter XPaths by looking for a parent ID
 - Save the name of the config file used to produce the diffs
 
### Long term
 - Save data to database instead of file
 - Make the consumer site faster by lazy loading data from database
